Missouri is the 30th richest state in the United States of America, with a per capita income of $19,936 (2000).Snow has been known to fall in Missouri as early as October, and as late as May. However, most of it falls in December, January, and February. As one would expect, the northern counties usually get the most snow. North of the Missouri River the winter snowfall averages 18 to 24 inches. </p>
